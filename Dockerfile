# ovos-persona-server serving a persona backed by this plugin's retrieval
# engine (opm.agents.retrieval, WolframAlphaRetrievalEngine). Every request
# hits api.wolframalpha.com and needs an "appid" key. The plugin itself
# bundles a shared demo key and falls back to it when none is configured
# (ovos_wolfram_alpha_plugin/__init__.py), so this image works out of the
# box -- entrypoint.sh reads WOLFRAM_APPID at start and only writes it into
# the persona config when set, otherwise the plugin's own demo-key fallback
# applies. See README.md for why you want your own key for real use.
